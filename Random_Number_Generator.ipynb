    "### 1. File Description\n",
    "This Python notebook file is written to ensure that every participant is **`randomly assigned`** to one of the two experimental conditions in the research - **Give An Option, or Give A Solution? The Role of Scepticism and Conversational Agentsâ€™ Decisional Guidance in Consumer Decision Making**. The research is conducted by **Yilan Wang** (Student Number: 12813168), a student in the research master's programme of Communication Science (September 2022 - July 2024) at University of Amsterdam, for her master's thesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Randomisation Methods and Rules\n",
    "The experiment expects a sample consists of 128 participants. 100 random numbers ranging from 1 to 1000 were generated in the first list, while 28 random numbers ranging from 1 to 280 were generated in the second list. Therefore, in both lists, each number has the same probability (10.0%) of being selected. The order of the following 128 random numbers is linked to the order of the registered appointment time slots for each participant in the lab's recruitment system https://www.lab.uva.nl/lab/recruitment/Projects/edit_participations/16280. When a participant signs up for this study, she/he or they will be marked with the latest number available on the timeline of all appointments of this research project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the number is **odd**, the participant is assigned to the experimental condition 1 - Informative Decisional Guidance (See the document **`Chatbot01.ipynb`** in the same folder).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If the number is **even**, the participant is assigned to the experimental condition 2 - Suggestive Decisional Guidance (See the document **`Chatbot02.ipynb`** in the same folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, because participants are allowed to sign up one hour before the experiment actually starts, the researcher needs to update the timeline of the appointments every time when a new participant signs up for the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Codes Description\n",
    "The following codes used the Python module `random` to generate random numbers.\n",
    "  - Specifically, `random.sample(population, k, *, counts=None)` which is used for random sampling returns a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population sequence.\n",
    "    - population: the set of numbers from which you want to retrieve your sample\n",
    "    - k: the sample length (the account of numbers that the sample contains)\n",
    "    - counts: how many times does each element appear in the sample\n",
    "     \n",
    "`range(1000)` and `range(280)` which enable sampling from a range of integers are used here instead of defining the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the module, please check the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"
