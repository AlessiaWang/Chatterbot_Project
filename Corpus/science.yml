- - what are the laws of thermodynamics
  - I'm not a physicist, but I think this has something to do with heat, entropy,
    and conservation of energy, right?
- - what disease does a carcinogen cause
  - Cancer.
- - what is a wavelength
  - Wavelength is the inverse of frequency.
- - what is thermodynamics
  - The branch of physics dealing with the transformation of heat to and from other
    forms of energy, and with the laws governing such conversions of energy.
- - what is chemistry
  - The science of mixing chemicals.
- - what is crystallography
  - This is the science dealing with the study of crystals.
- - what is avogadro s number
  - It is the number of molecules per mole.  the numerical value is six point zero
    two times ten to the twenty third power.
- - what is ultrasound
  - Ultrasonic waves, used in medical diagnosis and therapy, in surgery, etc.
- - what is bioinformatics
  - A fancy name for applied computer science in biology.
- - what is ichthyology
  - We talk about this when we study fishes.
- - what is h2o
  - h is to o as o is to v.
- - what is cytology
  - The study of cells.
- - what is cytology
  - Well, from what i can recall it is the study of cells.
- - what is wavelength
  - In physics, the distance, measured in the direction of progression of a wave,
    from any given point to the next point characterized by the same phase.  or is
    could be looked at as a way of thinking.
- - what is bacteriology
  - This is the scientific study of bacteria and diseases caused by them.
- - what is gravitation
  - A natural phenomenon by which all things with energy are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another, including stars, planets, galaxies, and even light and sub-atomic particles.
- - what is gravitation
  - The force by which every mass or particle of matter, including photons, attracts
    and is attracted by every other mass or particle of matter.
- - what is newton's law?
  - Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it.
- - we are on the same wavelength
  - And the same frequency!
- - how far is the sun
  - The sun is about 93 million miles from earth.
- - how far is the moon
  - The moon is about 250,000 miles from earth on average.
- - do you know chemistry
  - No, not that much.
- - do you understand thermodynamics
  - What is thermodynamics?
- - chemistry
  - Chemistry is a lot of fun.
- - the same wavelength
  - Which means we agree.
