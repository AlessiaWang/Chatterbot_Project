    "## 1. File Description\n",
    "This Python notebook file is written by **Yilan Wang** (Student Number: 12813168), a student in the research master's programme of Communication Science (September 2022 - July 2024) at University of Amsterdam. It aims to enable that the Python library `Chatterbot` (https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) run successfully on your laptop or PC. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Chatterbot` is used to build real chatbots that can provide messages as stimuli in the student's experimental research - **Give An Option, or Give A Solution? The Role of Scepticism and Conversational Agents’ Decisional Guidance in Consumer Decision Making**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Step-by-step Guide of Installation\n",
    "This guide is written to install Chatterbot to build and train chatbots on `Mac OS systems` (my version is Mac OS Sonoma 14.4.). It may require some different codes to run Chatterbot on the Windows system.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have run all the codes in this file and adjusted the python scripts on your laptop or PC according to instructions, you will be able to import the `Chatterbot` library and run the codes in `Chatbot01.ipynb` and `Chatbot02.ipynb` that allow you to build and train chatbots on your local computer.\n"
